Base58Check
===========
[Base58Check](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding) encoding in Elixir with the Bitcoin-specific alphabet. 


Usage
=====
Base58Check exposes 4 functions: `encode58/1, decode58/1, encode58check/2, decode58check/1`. `encode58check/2` accepts
a hex string, binary or integer and returns base58-encoded string. `decode58check/1` accepts a base58-encoded string
and returns a binary. 

```elixir
iex(1)> Base58Check.encode58check(128, "1e99423a4ed27608a15a2616a2b0e9e52ced330ac530edcc32c8ffc6a526aedd")
"5J3mBbAH58CpQ3Y5RNJpUKPE62SQ5tfcvU2JpbnkeyhfsYB1Jcn"

iex(2)> {prefix, payload} = Base58Check.decode58check("5J3mBbAH58CpQ3Y5RNJpUKPE62SQ5tfcvU2JpbnkeyhfsYB1Jcn")
iex(3)> Base.encode16(payload, case: :lower)
"1e99423a4ed27608a15a2616a2b0e9e52ced330ac530edcc32c8ffc6a526aedd"
iex(4)> :binary.decode_unsigned(prefix)
128
```
